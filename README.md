# WebGL Experiments

A little playground for testing things with webGL.

The goal is to re-learn 3D (I did a 3D game, with friends, more than 10 years ago) via a little project, involving procedural modelling.

## Goals : 
- Realtime vizualisation of the growing thing 
- constraints and collision detection (I'd want to make things growing *inside* forms or solids)
- export the generated model (to print it ^^);
